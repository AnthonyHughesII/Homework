![Goku Ultra Instinct](https://images7.alphacoders.com/909/thumb-1920-909480.jpg)

This is an image of the famous chracter, Goku in his strongest form. I am a big anime fan and its hard to be a big fan of anime without being a fan of Dragon Ball Z. This picture inspires me because Goku was not as ston enough to reach this far. He was far from it, but he worked hard day after day to continually grow and improve. That is what I want for myself, to consisently work hard and grow daily. It not easy as I have witnessed from Goku's example, but a strong dedication and a belief in yourself makes your potential limitless. You can make the future you envision, a reality with your own hands.
